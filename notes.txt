1. Based on the last meetup it seems a lot of you already know how to
make digital audio and video. Today I'm going to talk about some simple
software and inexpensive hardware you can use to interact with the
physical world.

2. With a basic understanding of electronics and some Googling you'll be
able to pull off all sorts of projects.

3. Chances are there are probably already products out there to do all
of these things.

4. If you're going to spend the time to make something, it should be
fun.

5. Maybe some of us have a different idea of fun?

1. Based on the last meetup it seems a lot of you already know how to
make digital audio and video. Today I'm going to talk about some simple
software and inexpensive hardware you can use to interact with the
physical world.

2. With a basic understanding of electronics and some Googling you'll be
able to pull off all sorts of projects.

3. Chances are there are probably already products out there to do all
of these things.

4. If you're going to spend the time to make something, it should be
fun.

5. Maybe some of us have a different idea of fun?

6. Arduino, it's Italian.

7. Two of the dozens of compatible models out there.

8. There's no reason to be scared.

9. Lets talk about the traffic light. There are three basic parts, the
   light circuitry, the network adapter and the code on the Arduino.

10. LED traffic lights were designed to be drop in replacements for. To
    keep things simple they have a power supply built in. We could plug
    these straight into the wall if we wanted.

    When working with a relay a few resistors and a diode are needed to
    protect the microcontroller, nothing complicated.

11. All kinds of expansion boards already exist. Motor controls, LCDs,
    network adapters, even wireless mesh network systems.

12. In the Arduino world they refer to programs as sketches. They use a
    simplified version of C++. Here's the bootstrapping code for the
    traffic light. The network layer adds another hundred or so lines,
    but could probably be minimized if I wasn't so lazy.
